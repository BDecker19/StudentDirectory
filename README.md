StudentDirectory
================

A basic app for creating a directory of students enrolled on the WDI course.

# Install

1. fork this repository using the fork button
2. git clone your own version into your projects folder
3. cd into projects/StudentDirectory
4. ruby student.rb

# TODO

1. Add attributes that you want to know about your classmates (don't be nosy...)
2. Finish the implementation so that you ask for all the attributes in your classes and save them in attr_accessors.
3. Refactor this code so that we can create a Student or an Instructor, based on the users imput (a bit like the Factory pattern we saw earlier...).
4. Make any other improvements you see fit
5. Go around the class and ask your classmates to complete the information provided
6. Check that you have a student_directory.yml file in your project folder.
